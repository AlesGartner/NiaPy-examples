## Installation

1. Clone or download [NiaPy-examples](https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy-examples).
2. Navigate to one of the CEC competitions folders, e.g. to `cec2021` by running `cd cec2021`.
3. Install dependencies by running `make setup`.
4. Build the library by running `make build`.
5. Shared library should be installed.
6. For a simple run, navigate `cd ..` and run `python run_cec.py -a BatAlgorithm -c 18 -r log`.
7. If build has been successful, simple run should output function values and coordinates.
